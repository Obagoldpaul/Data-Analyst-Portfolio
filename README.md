## Projects

### Project 1: [Google Anayltics Capstone: Cyclistic Bike-share Analysis](https://github.com/Obagoldpaul/Project-1.git)

- **Description**
  
In this project, I conducted a detailed analysis of bike-share data for Cyclistic company. The primary objective was to gain insights into how casual and member riders use the cyclistic bike differently, identify trends, and provide actionable recommendations for converting casual riders to members.

- **Technologies Used**

R & Tableau.

- **Data Source**
  
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from the company's internal database. It includes sales data for the past one year, with information on bikes, users, and stations.

- **Analysis**

The analysis was conducted using R for data preprocessing and Tableau for in-depth visualizations and insights.
1. **Data Cleaning:** I performed pre-cleaning activities to ensure data integrity, including checking for consistency, accuracy, and completeness.
2. **Data Import:** I imported 12 datasets covering the period from August 2022 to July 2023 into the R environment.
3. **Data Merging:** The datasets were merged into a single dataframe for comprehensive analysis.
4. **Data Validation:** I confirmed the consistency of column names and data types.
5. **Handling Null Values:** Null values were identified but retained in the analysis due to their potential significance.
6. **Calculating Ride Duration:** A new column called "duration in Secs" was calculated by finding the difference between the "ended_at" and "started_at" timestamps.
7. **Filtering Ride Duration:** Rides with a duration less than or equal to zero were removed from the dataset.

- **Key Findings**
  
    + Casual customers accounted for a smaller proportion of rides (37.90%) compared to members (62.10%).
    + Casual customers took longer rides on average, suggesting a leisurely ride purpose, while members may have primarily used bikes for daily commuting.
    + Longer rides were commonly taken on weekends, suggesting that customers had more time for extended rides during their leisure days.
    + The most active months of the year were from May to October, indicating that biking is preferred during the warmer seasons.
    + The most frequently used start and end station for both customer types was Streeter Dr & Grand Ave, indicating its popularity as a biking hub.

- **Recommendation**

  + Create special **6 month package** leaning towards membership plan from May to October.
  + Discounts on annual membership plan to casual riders with longer rides duration.
  + Awards or Prizes on longer rides available to only Cyclistic annual members.
  + The campaign should be targeted at casuals most used start and end stations. It will be most effective during May to October from Fridays to Saturdays.
